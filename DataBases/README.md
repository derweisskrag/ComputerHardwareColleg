# Data Bases Course!

Here, I publish my homework and academic papers related to the course in Narva Tartu College.

## The first project - TODO App

**Purpose:** To demonstrate how to use databases with modern JavaScript framework

**Description:** The database is used to store and create TODOs (a task to do). Whenever we hit refresh, they will not disappear because NEXT renders content both statically (SSG) and in the server-side way (SSR). Therefore, data is being loaded to the DOM content and we dynamically see it if the request is allowed. It means that data related to a TODO persists across sessions.
