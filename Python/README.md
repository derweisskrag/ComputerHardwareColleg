# Python 
Here I publish source code written in Python.

## How to run?

You can install Python from (official webpage)[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/?ref=upstract.com]. 

Once installed, you can open up terminal and type `py` or `python`. This enters Python shell where you can write Python code:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
